# Game Theory - Quick Guide

## Introduction
Game theory in DSA typically involves two-player zero-sum games where both players play optimally.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Nim Game
```
Players take turns removing objects
Last player to move wins (or loses)
Winning strategy exists
```
**Problem:** Nim Game - LeetCode #292

### 2. Minimax Algorithm
```
Maximize player's score while minimizing opponent's
Used in two-player games
```

### 3. Alpha-Beta Pruning
Optimization of minimax

### 4. Game States
- **Winning State:** Current player can force a win
- **Losing State:** Current player will lose with optimal play
- **Neutral State:** Draw possible

## Common Patterns:
- Grundy Numbers (Sprague-Grundy Theorem)
- Dynamic Programming on game states
- Backtracking with memoization

## Problems:
- Stone Game - LeetCode #877
- Predict the Winner - LeetCode #486
- Can I Win - LeetCode #464
- Flip Game II - LeetCode #294
