# Advanced Data Structures

## Bloom Filters
**Purpose:** Probabilistic data structure for membership testing
**Space:** Very efficient
**False positives:** Possible
**False negatives:** Never
**Use:** Spell checkers, databases, caching

## Skip Lists
**Purpose:** Probabilistic alternative to balanced trees
**Operations:** O(log n) average
**Use:** Redis uses for sorted sets

## Splay Trees
**Purpose:** Self-adjusting binary search tree
**Amortized:** O(log n)
**Use:** Recently accessed elements are quick

## Treap (Tree + Heap)
**Purpose:** Randomized BST
**Operations:** O(log n) expected
**Properties:** BST by keys, heap by priorities

## Persistent Data Structures
**Purpose:** Preserve previous versions after modification
**Use:** Functional programming, version control

## Heavy-Light Decomposition
**Purpose:** Tree decomposition technique
**Use:** Complex tree queries

## Link-Cut Trees
**Purpose:** Dynamic tree structure
**Use:** Network flow algorithms
